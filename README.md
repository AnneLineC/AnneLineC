### Hi, I'm Anne-Line, a French developer ðŸ‘‹

ðŸš€ Currently in a work-study contract with theTribe (a french company) and the O'Clock school, until february 2024.

ðŸŒ± Concerned about code quality, I'm very interested in good practices and software carftmanship, to which I want to go deeper in (TDD, clean architecture, DDD...).

*More about me :* After studying international agro-development ingineering at first, I swiched to taking care of a numeric collaborative map for three years, giving me the opportunity to reconnect with my early enthusiasm for digital. Then, I decided to retrain in web development with the O'Clock school (JS/PHP based program), specializing on React.js and its ecosystem. And after a 6 months internship into a company (working on React.js), I decided to go deeper into my studies through a work-study contract, allowing me to learn a lot of new languages, tools and concepts.
