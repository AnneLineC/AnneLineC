### Hi, I'm Anne-Line, a French developer ğŸ‘‹

ğŸš€ Currently in a work-study contract with theTribe (a french company) and the O'Clock school, until february 2024.

ğŸŒ± Concerned about code quality, I'm very interested in good practices and software carftmanship, to which I want to go deeper in (TDD, clean architecture, DDD...).
